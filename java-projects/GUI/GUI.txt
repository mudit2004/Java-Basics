GUI    <-- Graphical User Interface
---

-> user interacts with the program with Graphical methods.
-> In Gui we need to do :
	> Designing the user interface. 
	> logic. 
-> This type of event is called as Delegation Event Model.
-> Delegation Event Model is used to design Java Gui.
-> Delegation Event Model has three things :
	> Event
	> EventSource
	> EventListener (Has the logic)
-> Most of the Time , An Event is an user defined Action or some time it is a Bulit-in Action (like... Timer Object)
-> Each Event is registered to an EventListener.
-> Event and EventSource are class, And EventListener is interface.
-> Event Source can have multiple EventListener.
